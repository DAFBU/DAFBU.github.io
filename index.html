		<h1>D.A.F.B.U.</h1>
		<p>Dave and Frank bought unicycles one day after work</p>
		<p>Sadly they don't know how to ride unicycles</p>
		<p>Dave and Frank invited a friend from work over to help them out</p>
		<p>Their friend show them how to ride a unicycle then let them have a go</p>
		<p>Dave hopped onto the unicycle and stayed on it for only five seconds before he hit a bump on the footpath</p>
		<p>Dave was in pain and never wanted to ride a unicycle again</p>
		<p>Frank wanted to give it a go so he hopped onto the unicycle but he only stayed on for ten second before hitting the same bump and fell off</p>
		<p>Frank was in pain and he too never wanted to ride a unicycle again</p>
		<p>So Dave and Frank thought and thought and finally decided to give the unicycle to their friend Jack</p>
		<p>Jack got the unicycle and Dave and Frank got $10 each</p>
		<p>Jack really enjoyed his new unicycle and rid it all day long</p>
		<p>               THE END</p>
