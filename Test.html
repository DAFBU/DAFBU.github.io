		<p>Dave went to a fair one day</p>
		<p>At this fair there were rides, candy, games and prizes</p>
		<p>Dave really enjoyed the fair so he called up Frank t see if he wanted to come to the fair</p>
		<p>Frank arrived at the fair in a good mood but sadly Dave and Frank left the fair feeling terrible</p>

		<p>Then clowns turned up on unicycles and Jack was one of them</p>

		<p>Jack came over to say he was sorry about what happened</p>
